DealDroid is  small application for [Android](http://www.android.com) devices that continuously watches for new deals on one-deal-at-a-time sites like [BonkTown](http://www.bonktown.com/?avad=14749), [Brociety](http://www.brociety.com/?avad=14749), [ChainLove](http://www.chainlove.com/?avad=14749), [Steep and Cheap](http://www.steepandcheep.com/?avad=14749), [Tramdock](http://www.tramdock.com/?avad=14749), [Whiskey Militia](http://www.whiskeymilitia.com/?avad=14749), [Woot](http://www.woot.com) and associated sites, [ThingFling](http://www.thingfling.com), and [SlickDeals](http://www.slickdeals.net).  DealDroid runs in the background and produces Android notifications when new items become available.

You can configure how aggressively the software will search for new items, as frequent background updates and keeping the phone awake may decrease battery life a bit.  Although, I have not noticed any significant battery drain on my G1 using a 2 minute check interval.

Currently, DealDroid supports all of [BackCountry.com](http://www.backcountry.com/?avad=14749)'s one-deal-at-a-time sites and a few others that I find interesting.  More sites are on the way in future versions.  If there is a site you'd like added, please open an issue here on Google Code.

You can find some really incredible offers on these sites, with discounts of up to 75%.  Unfortunately, you have to play their game, and stay on top of the current offers at all times if you want to find the best deals.  I picked up most of the snowboarding gear I am riding this year from [Whiskey Militia](http://www.whiskeymilitia.com/?avad=14749).

Check out some [Screenshots](Screenshots.md) of the application in action or view the recent [Changes](Changes.md).

Feel free to contact me directly at [shade@chemlab.org](mailto:shade@chemlab.org) with feedback, enhancement requests, ideas, job offers, or free snowboarding equipment.  Or, you can file an issue here on Google Code.

DealDroid is free and opensource, but if this app helps you get some nice gear and save a ton of money in the process, please consider donating to the project:

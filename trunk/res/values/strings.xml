<string name="about">About DealDroid</string>
<string name="about_summary">DealDroid is a very simple application for checking various one-at-a-time deal sites, where a single item is sold at a
usually large discount for a limited amount of time.  When the time is up, the site switches to a new item.  DealDroid will create notifications
when these sites are updated, so you never miss a good deal again.</string>
